# Kiwi-Bubble-Pricing-Analytics

Kiwi is a major soft drink company. They own and sell “Kiwi Regular” and the product currently is doing well in the market. The main competitor, Mango, produces “Mango Bubbles” that is well-received in the market as well. Their guess is that Mango does well because consumers prefer “Bubbles” over “Kiwi” – but they have the better brand name than Mango, thus their product also does well. Now, a spark comes to their mind: why not launching a new product, “Kiwi Bubbles”? The product combines the best of characteristics “Bubbles” and the brand name “Kiwi”, and should be able to do well. Then they launched the product in a test market and collected consumer loyalty card data to aid their global launching and pricing decisions. For the entire project, assume that all 3 products have $0.50 unit costs and market size is 1000 consumers. <br>
We have a subsample of the data set, ”kiwi bubbles P2.csv” . The data set records the choices of soft drink of 359 consumers over the course of 3 years. The columns are consumer ID, week code, softdrink-buying trip number of the consumer in the sample period, and prices of zero product (not buying), Kiwi Bubbles, Kiwi Regular and Mango Bubbles (99 means that product was out of stock), and consumer choice. A consumer in a given week only buys one or none of the 3 products. We also have a demographic data-set, ”demo.csv”, for some of the consumers (whose rough description is available in ”demo description.xlsx”).
